.SH NAME
koinode \- Cluster management and administration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B koinode
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
KOI is a high availability service manager, designed to manage services across two or more machines on a network. 
.PP
The name KOI is derived from its origins as a set of extensions on top of UCARP, the user space implementation of the CARP virtual IP protocol. However, KOI no longer builds upon UCARP and does not directly handle virtual IP assignment or transfer.
.PP
KOI is suitable for small clusters, managing a single or a few applications. It is particularly designed to handle services that have both an active and a passive mode of operation.
