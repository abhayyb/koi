.SH NAME
koi \- Command-line interface to a \fBkoi\fR cluster
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B koi
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI<command> \fR[\fIargs\fR..]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBkoi\fR is the command-line interface of KOI, a
cluster management and administration tool. KOI connects
to a koinode cluster node and executes queries or commands to control
the cluster. This can be done from one of the machines included in
the cluster, or from any machine on the network.
.PP
Communication is encrypted
using the cluster password, so koi requires access to the same configuration
file as used by the local koinode.
